<h4><b>About Evolution Gym</b></h4>

We have a variety of Hammer Strength plate loaded machines and squat racks.   But we’re more than just a power lifting gym.

 <br>
 <p class="fs-5">Becoming a member is easy! Simply come in take a minute to fill out some paper work (don’t worry it’s just a release of liability and a copy of the rules), and start your membership.  There is never an enrollment fee, card fee, or contract to sign and we don’t make it mandatory to charge your bank account every month for your membership, but if you would like the convenience of not worrying about your due date we can set up automatic payments. The day you sign up is your due date, pay for a month you get a month. Pay for a multiple month package that’s what you get, it’s that simple.</p>
<p class="fs-5">Evolution Gym is the gym for people who are looking to get in shape or looking to stay strong.  It’s the gym where no one cares how much you can lift just that you are serious about what you are doing and working hard.  You can ask anyone for a helping hand and they’re more than willing to give you a spot or answer a question because they truly love working out.  No one cares if you’re wearing the latest hi-tech workout gear or an old pair of gym shorts and Chuck Taylors.</p>
